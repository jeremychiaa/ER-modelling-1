# database-design

## Purpose
- The purpose of this project is to create a relational database model and use an entity relationship model for database design
- This project is done as part of my university project for the course Practical Database Concepts

## Tools
- LucidChart, Microsoft Word

## Workflow
### Entity-Relationship Modelling
1. Designing and planning for the implementation of a database system, diagramming the design to a high standard using UML notation through the diagramming tool Lucidchart.
2. Modelling the activities of an organisation and presenting the model as an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram. Analysing this ER diagram, and possibly modifying it, based on additional client requirements.
3. Mapping an ER diagram into a relational database schema, showing every step of the mapping.
